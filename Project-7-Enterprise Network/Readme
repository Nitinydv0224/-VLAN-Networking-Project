# Enterprise Network Project: Multiple Routers, VLAN Trunking, and Static Routing

## **Project Overview**

This project simulates a **real-world enterprise network** using two Cisco 2811 routers, two Cisco 2960 switches, VLAN trunking, and static routing. The setup demonstrates how multiple VLANs on a single switch communicate across routers while maintaining inter-VLAN connectivity and network segmentation.

Key features:

- **Two Routers (2811):** Interconnect VLANs and manage static routing.  
- **Two Switches (2960):** Support multiple VLANs with trunk links.  
- **Serial Connection:** Direct router-to-router link for inter-network communication.  
- **VLANs:** Separate network traffic for different departments.  
- **Static Routing:** Deterministic paths between VLANs and routers.  
- **PCs:** Two PCs per VLAN to test connectivity.
