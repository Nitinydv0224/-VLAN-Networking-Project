                                       ******** About VLAN ********
A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is used to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks.
It reduces broadcast traffic, enhances security, and improves network efficiency.
In this repository, you‚Äôll find step-by-step labs showing how VLANs are created, connected, and managed across multiple switches and routers.
