# Project  ‚Äì Inter-VLAN Routing

## üìò Project Description
This project demonstrates **Inter-VLAN Routing**, a method used to enable communication between different VLANs in a network.  
In normal VLAN configuration, devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly.  
By configuring **a router-on-a-stick setup**, we allow multiple VLANs to send and receive traffic through a single router interface using **802.1Q trunking**.

---

## üß† Objective
- To configure **multiple VLANs** on a single switch.
- To enable **communication between VLANs** using a router.
- To understand how **trunk ports** and **sub-interfaces** work together.

---

## üß© Network Topology
- **Device Used:** Cisco 2960 Switch, 1 Router, 8 PCs  
- **VLANs Created:**
  - VLAN 10 ‚Üí Sales Department
  - VLAN 20 ‚Üí HR Department
  - VLAN 30 ‚Üí IT Department
  - VLAN 40 ‚Üí Admin Department

Each VLAN has two PCs connected to specific switch ports.

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Simulation Software)  
- **Switch:** Cisco 2960  
- **Router:** Cisco 2911  
- **End Devices:** 8 PCs
