ðŸ§  Project 6 â€” Dynamic IP Allocation and Inter-VLAN Communication using DHCP and Router-on-a-Stick

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project demonstrates how to configure automatic IP address allocation using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and enable inter-VLAN communication through a Router-on-a-Stick configuration.

Each VLAN represents a department in a company, and all IP addresses are assigned automatically by the router, which also handles communication between VLANs.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Create multiple VLANs (e.g., VLAN 10 for Sales, VLAN 20 for HR).

Assign switch ports to VLANs.

Configure trunking between the switch and router.

Configure router sub-interfaces for VLANs (Router-on-a-Stick).

Configure DHCP pools on the router for automatic IP assignment.

Verify connectivity and inter-VLAN communication.

ðŸŒŸ Results

âœ… Each VLAN receives IP addresses automatically via DHCP.
âœ… Router enables communication between VLANs using sub-interfaces.
âœ… Network setup mimics real enterprise configuration.

ðŸ’¡ Advantages

No Manual IP Configuration Needed â€” DHCP automatically assigns IPs.

Easy Network Expansion â€” Adding new devices requires no manual setup.

Centralized Management â€” Router handles both IP assignment and routing.

Efficient Communication â€” Different VLANs can communicate securely.

Realistic Enterprise Design â€” Commonly used in medium and large organizations.
